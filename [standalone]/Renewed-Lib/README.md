## Renewed Library
This is a collection of functions and framework intergration used for Renewed-Scripts, feel free to use it in your own scripts if you feel like or improve anything by doing a PR.

Also thanks to Overextended for some of the bridge logic specifically the job versions from ox_inventory :)

## Installation

* Install ox_lib and have it started before Renewed Lib
* Make sure to have qb/esx installed for framework intergration
* Drag and drop the resource into your resources folder and Enjoy!

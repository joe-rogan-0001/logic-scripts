Big thanks to [Spazd](https://github.com/Spazd) and [uShifty](https://github.com/uShifty) who initially created this script and allowed me to release this on my Github!

And special thanks to [helenclarko#5367](https://github.com/helenclarko) and [FJamZoo](https://github.com/FjamZoo)!. They posted and worked on a snippet on the [RenewedScripts](https://discord.com/invite/AS2Y8TWejt) Discord which I partially incorperated in this script.

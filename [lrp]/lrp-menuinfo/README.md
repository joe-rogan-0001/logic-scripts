# Character-Pause-Menu-Info
This script allows you to edit the pause menu in FiveM. You'll be able to add a custom title and subtitle. The script will also connect to QBCore's character system to display your characters name, cash, and bank balance information. ```Version: 1.0.0```

This script is dependent on the [QBCore Framework](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/).

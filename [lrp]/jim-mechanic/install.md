# INSTALLATION

## Add the script to the server resources
- I highly recommend putting the `jim-mechanic` folder in a new folder called `[jim]`
- Then add `ensure [jim]` AFTER your other scripts in your server.cfg

---
# Item installation
- Add the image files from the zip to your `qb-inventory > html > images` folder

- Add these lines to your lrp-coree > shared lua under the Items section
```lua

----------------------
# Dependancies

- This script requires `lrp-menu` and `lrp-input` for the menu systems
- This script requires `lrp-target` for opening stores, crafting tables, cash registers, going on duty, nos refill

- This script is also designed to use `jim-payments` (https://github.com/jimathy/jim-payments) for charging customs and sending money to the society accounts

----------------------
## NOS + Odometer

There are expanded features included in this scripts with SQL
The included .SQL file needs to be imported into your player_vehicles database to add the appropriate columns (traveldistance, hasnitro, noslevel)

The `hasnitro` and `noslevel` columns being added enables the of saving Nitrous levels through server restarts

The `traveldistance` column adds an Odometer to the toolbox/mechanic_tools menus, this this can retrieved in miles or kilometers.

----------------------
# QB-MechanicJob

**You don't need `qb-mechanicjob` to use this script**

Extra damages will be enabled by default if you use `qb-mechanicjob` and `qb-vehiclefailure`

This needs to be added the the main script, but if you **DON'T** want to use qb-mechanicjob but have an updated qb-vehiclefailure
replace this event in qb-vehiclefailure > client.lua. This will make it only work if qb-mechanicjob is started.

```lua
-- Functions
local function DamageRandomComponent()
	if GetResourceState('qb-mechanicjob') ~= "started" then return end
    local dmgFctr = math.random() + math.random(0, 2)
    local randomComponent = DamageComponents[math.random(1, #DamageComponents)]
    local randomDamage = (math.random() + math.random(0, 1)) * dmgFctr
    exports['qb-mechanicjob']:SetVehicleStatus(QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle), randomComponent, exports['qb-mechanicjob']:GetVehicleStatus(QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle), randomComponent) - randomDamage)
end
```

## Creating new polyzone for a new location

How do I create PolyZones for a new job location?

These locations determine where a person will be put on duty or taken off duty, and the places where items can be used, if you set them to be restricted to zones.

To start you need to be near the building you want to add.

Type `/pzcreate poly` to start creating a PolyZone. Pick a name, this doesn't matter as you can set this later in locations.lua
You will then get a red line right where you are standing.

Use your ARROW keys to move this around to the first corner/point you want to place.
When its in the correct place, type `/pzadd` and this will lock the current point and allow you to create another

Repeat this until your last corner/point where you will type `/pzfinish`.

This will save all the vectors of the points you have chosen and place them in a file called: `polyzone_created_zones.txt`

In this file is the vectors that you need to copy over to my scripts.

----------------------
## "mechboard" item

**This isn't fully required but helps organise multiples of the "mechboard"**

The MechBoard item is an item given to the person who uses the preview menu and makes changes

To make full use of this item you need to add the ability for the item to show item info in your inventory system

I have only done this with `qb-inventory` and `lj-inventory` as they are similar

`qb-inventory/html/js/app.js`

- Search for "harness" or Scroll down until you find:
```js
} else if (itemData.name == "harness") {
    $(".item-info-title").html("<p>" + itemData.label + "</p>");
    $(".item-info-description").html(
        "<p>" + itemData.info.uses + " uses left.</p>"
    );
```
- Directly underneath this add:
```js
} else if (itemData.name == "mechboard") {
    $(".item-info-title").html("<p>" + itemData.label + "</p>");
    $(".item-info-description").html(
        "<p>" + itemData.info.vehplate + "</p>" +
        "<p>" + itemData.info.veh + "</p>"
    );
```
When successfully added the mechboards will show the vehicle and plate number

----------------------

## Updating core events

To add the ability to save RGB paints, their colour finishes and drift/bulletproof tires you need to change two functions in your lrp-coree/client/functions.lua

Replace GetVehicleProperties and SetVehicleProperties functions with these:
```lua
function QBCore.Functions.GetVehicleProperties(vehicle)
    if DoesEntityExist(vehicle) then
        local pearlescentColor, wheelColor = GetVehicleExtraColours(vehicle)

            local _, r, g, b = GetVehicleXenonLightsCustomColor(vehicle)
            headlightColor = { r, g, b }
        else
            headlightColor = GetVehicleHeadlightsColour(vehicle)
        end

            local r, g, b = GetVehicleCustomPrimaryColour(vehicle)
            colorPrimary = { r, g, b, colorPrimary }

    - Fix Wheels + free repair issues, can now use freerepair with tyres correctly - repair.lua
    - Fix `Config.StashCraft` showing checkmarks in the menu - locations.lua
    - Potential fix for saved RGB xenons not loading when pulling from garage - functionserver.lua + xenons.lua

        - This REQUIRES updating the core functions from the install.md again
        - Better checks and cleanup for if the vehicle exists or not

## 2.9.5:
    - Fixes for repair.lua

## 2.9.4:
    - Changes to `functions.lua`
        - Changed the auto-save of vehicle mods to rely on plate instead of entity number
        - This will help the people who park modify their cars and park them 2 seconds later
        - This should also help with players speeding away from mechanics before their clients have saved the mods
    - Changes to `repair.lua`
        - Item checks (when StashRepair is false) are now client side
        - This allows better control of lrp-menu, stopping you from trying to repair with no items

    - Moved UpdateDelay timer to the config - functions.lua / config.lua
    - Remove a check from the vehicle update event as it was causing some massive issues for people - functions.lua
        - I think this is linked to being too far from the vehicle when its updating

        - Improved detection of if the entity exists
    - Fix item removal being all kinds of broken when repairing from the player inventory - main.lua
    - Fix tire item removal being all kinds of broken - repair.lua
    - Fix animations not working if you weren't repairing from stash - repair.lua
    - Server Side + Client Side QBCore HasItem functions are now built into the script
        - This will help to recduce the kicks and errors people are getting - functions.lua / main.lua
        - This also requires update to performance.lua

## 2.9.2Hotfix:
    - Fix issue that was causing KuzQuality's Realistic Wheels to remove wheels when doing anything in the script
        - This also fixes an issue that was causing some players to notice "Lowered rear suspension"

    - Added check to see if vehicle needs to have its properties force changed for other players when updating - functions.lua
    - StashTidy() now allows stacking of unstackable items (too big for pockets, not too big for a stash) - craftingserver.lua
    - Lowered the odometer math back down by x10 due to yet more complaints - extras.lua
    - Reduced /preview check loop time to help reduce exploits
    - Overhauled the Neon/Xenon colours menus
        - Added support for RGB Xenon headlights
        - This needs to be synced to all players manually so added server side events - functionserver.lua

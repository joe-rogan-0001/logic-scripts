# esx_dmvschool converted to QBCore with added details
 We all know the old dmvschool from esx. Well welcome it to QBCore framework with a few new details.

# Installation
Insert the below item into the shared.lua of qb-core
```
['permit']						 = {['name'] = 'permit',						['label'] = 'Driving Permit',			['weight'] = 0,			['type'] = 'item',		['image'] = 'id_card.png',				['unique'] = true,		['useable'] = true,		['shouldClose'] = false,   ['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = 'A Driving permit to show you can drive a vehicle as long as you have a passenger'},
```

If you want to give players an id_card instead then go into the server.lua and replace any instance of permit to id_card and don't worry about adding the above line.
Update:(you will have to add the license to the table for exsisting players as it wont auto update.) -- atleast to my knowledge

Open qb-core/server/players.lua and find:

```
PlayerData.metadata['licences'] = PlayerData.metadata['licences'] or {
        ['driver'] = true,
        ['business'] = false,
        ['weapon'] = false,
    }
```
and replace with:
```
PlayerData.metadata['licences'] = PlayerData.metadata['licences'] or {
        ['driver'] = false,
        ['business'] = false,
        ['weapon'] = false,
        ['permit'] = false
    }
```
Open qb-core/shared.lua and find ```QBShared.StarterItems``` and remove the driver license line.

Open qb-cityhall/client/main.lua and replace
```
local idTypes = {
    ["id_card"] = {
        label = "ID Card",
        item = "id_card"
    },
    ["driver_license"] = {
        label = "Drivers License",
        item = "driver_license"
    },
    ["weaponlicense"] = {
        label = "Firearms License",
        item = "weaponlicense"
    }
}
```

with

```
local idTypes = {
    ["id_card"] = {
        label = "ID Card",
        item = "id_card"
    },
    ["driver_license"] = {
        label = "Drivers License",
        item = "driver_license"
    },
    ["weaponlicense"] = {
        label = "Firearms License",
        item = "weaponlicense"
    },
    ["permit"] = {
        label = "Drivers Permit",
        item = "permit"
    }
}
```

and replace
```
RegisterNUICallback('requestLicenses', function(data, cb)
    local PlayerData = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerData()
    local licensesMeta = PlayerData.metadata["licences"]
    local availableLicenses = {}

    for type,_ in pairs(licensesMeta) do
        if licensesMeta[type] then
            local licenseType = nil
            local label = nil

            if type == "driver" then
                licenseType = "driver_license"
                label = "Drivers Licence"
            elseif type == "weapon" then
                licenseType = "weaponlicense"
                label = "Firearms License"
            end

            availableLicenses[#availableLicenses+1] = {
                idType = licenseType,
                label = label
            }
        end
    end
    cb(availableLicenses)
end)
```
with
```

        if licensesMeta[type] then
            local licenseType = nil
            local label = nil

            if type == "driver" then
                licenseType = "driver_license"
                label = "Drivers Licence"
            elseif type == "weapon" then
                licenseType = "weaponlicense"
                label = "Firearms License"
            elseif type == "permit" then
                licenseType = "permit"
                label = "Drivers Permit"
            end

            availableLicenses[#availableLicenses+1] = {
                idType = licenseType,
                label = label
            }
        end
    end
    cb(availableLicenses)
end)
```

And last go to qb-cityhall/server/main.lua and replace:
```

    end

    Player.Functions.AddItem(identityData.item, 1, nil, info)

    TriggerClientEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', src, QBCore.Shared.Items[identityData.item], 'add')

        info.birthdate = Player.PlayerData.charinfo.birthdate
        info.type = "Drivers Permit"
    end

    Player.Functions.AddItem(identityData.item, 1, nil, info)
    TriggerClientEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', src, QBCore.Shared.Items[identityData.item], 'add')
    Player.Functions.RemoveMoney("cash", 50)
end)
```

# New Details

Added Permit to database defaults false. So now qb-dmv won't look to see if they have the item in their inventory rather the database to see if true or false. So they can't spam taking the test.

Fixed the Drivers Test activating upon opening the Menu. Now Drivers Test activates upon clicking Start Drivers Test.

Fixed the players from being able to go back to the dmv menu to start a second driver's test while the original is still going.

Added a config for GiveItem. If false then upon completion of the drivers test then they have to go to City Hall to Buy a license. If true then qb-dmv will give them the item.

Added Permit upon completion of Theoretical test

Vehicle will despawn once MaxErrors(can be edited in config.lua) has been reached

Player will be teleported back to the DMV once MaxErrors has been reached.

Theoritcal Test UI has been updated and looks different.

Added ability to only have to take Theoritcal Test(Config.DriversTest) if it is set to false then players will only have to take Theoritcal test to get a Driver's License. Set to True to make players take driving test to get a drivers license.

Maybe others that I can't think of at the moment.

# Planned Details

Make it so players must be in starting vehicle to complete the drivers test
